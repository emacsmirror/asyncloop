The expression (asyncloop-remainder ID) returns the list of functions

If, as most likely, we're called from within a function that's
called by a running asyncloop, you can schedule a new function
invocation to be run on the next \"tick\" like this:

(push #'some-additional-function (asyncloop-remainder ID))

which can be useful for looping through a list by consuming it
one item at a time: have a function push itself back onto the
execution queue until the list is empty."

Also pass ID onwards as an argument to this function to allow it
to manipulate the running asyncloop, via `asyncloop-remainder'.

Finally, schedule another invocation of `asyncloop-chomp'.  Optional
argument POLITE ensures waiting for at least 1 second of idle
time before invoking.

PER-STAGE same as in `asyncloop-run'.

Note that `asyncloop-chomp' must be called indirectly via
`named-timer-run'; to call it any other way will hopefully
trigger an error.  This mandate helps preserve the expected
behavior from the chain of timers, since `named-timer-run'
cancels any call that may have been pending, avoiding
double-calls."

  "Attempt to run the series of functions in list FUNS.

Run them as a pseudo-asynchronous loop that pauses for user
activity to keep Emacs feeling snappy.

The loop as a whole is assigned an identifier based on uniqueness
of input, and refuses to run multiple instances with the same
identifier.  That means that if, perhaps accidentally, you call
this several times with identical input in a very short
timeframe, only the first invocation does anything, and the rest
may no-op in favour of letting the already running asyncloop
finish.  You may also explicitly specify ID; make it a symbol.

If the previous asyncloop seems to have been interrupted and left
in an incomplete state, call the optional function
ON-INTERRUPT-DISCOVERED, then resume the loop, picking up where
it was left off.

For each function in the asyncloop, call the optional function
PER-STAGE just before.

All the functions inside FUNS and those provided in the optional
arguments are passed one argument: the identifier for the loop.
See `asyncloop-remainder' and `asyncloop-defuse' for how that can
be used."
