(cl-defun asyncloop-run (funs &key on-interrupt-discovered debug launch-message id)
  "Attempt to run the series of functions in list FUNS.

Run them as a pseudo-asynchronous loop that pauses for user
activity to keep Emacs feeling snappy.

The loop as a whole is assigned an identifier based on uniqueness
of input, and refuses to run multiple instances with the same
identifier.  That means that if, perhaps accidentally, you call
this several times with identical input in a short timeframe,
only the first invocation is likely to do anything, and the rest
will no-op in favor of letting the already running asyncloop
finish.

(Though you'll likely not need it, you can supply a custom symbol
ID, which also predetermines the name of the associated debug
buffer: \"*ID*\", and the timer in `named-timer-table'.)

If the previous loop with the same identifier seems to have been
interrupted and left in an incomplete state, call the optional
function ON-INTERRUPT-DISCOVERED, then resume the loop, picking
up where it was left off.  To reiterate, this doesn't happen when
the interrupt happens, only the next time `asyncloop-run' itself
is triggered.

\(Tip: It's not unlikely to get spurious interrupts because the
user types C-g at inopportune times, but it's also possible it's
intentional, and we must always respect a C-g.  If you're having
problems with insistent restarts, you could set
ON-INTERRUPT-DISCOVERED to `asyncloop-cancel' to get some
breathing room and watch the loop restart in full, which should
help you debug what's going on.  The problem is likely
appropriately solved with a sanity check at the start of every
function in FUNS.\)

All the functions inside FUNS and those provided in the optional
arguments are passed one argument: the loop object, which holds
all of this metadata.  This lets you inspect and manipulate the
running loop by passing the object to any of:

        (asyncloop-log loop "Loop finished, total wall-time %.2fs" elapsed)))))

;;;###autoload
(cl-defun asyncloop-run (funs &key on-interrupt-discovered debug-buffer-name)
  "Attempt to run the series of functions in list FUNS.
Execute them in sequence, but pause on user activity to keep
Emacs feeling snappy.

The loop as a whole refuses to start twice with the same input if
the last invocation has not yet completed.  That means that if,
perhaps via a hook that triggers often, you call this several
times in a short timeframe, only the first invocation is likely
to do anything, and the rest will no-op in favor of letting the
already running loop finish.

If the previous loop with the same input seems to have been
interrupted by an error and left in an incomplete state, first
call the optional function ON-INTERRUPT-DISCOVERED, then resume
the loop, picking up where it was left off.  To reiterate, this
recovery won't happen at the moment the loop is interrupted, only
the next time you execute `asyncloop-run' itself (which could be
a long while or never, depending on what hook you put it on).

If you're having problems with insistent restarts, you could set
ON-INTERRUPT-DISCOVERED to `asyncloop-cancel' to get some
breathing room and watch the loop restart in full, which should
help you debug what's going on.  The problem is likely
appropriately solved with a sanity check at the start of most/all
functions in FUNS.

All the functions in FUNS, as well as the optional
ON-INTERRUPT-DISCOVERED function, are passed one argument: the

It does not matter what the functions in FUNS return, but the
debug buffer prints the return values, so by returning something
interesting \(ideally a string constructed by `format'), you can
improve your debugging experience.

To have a function in FUNS repeat itself until some condition is
met \(in the style of a while-loop), have it push itself onto the
result of `asyncloop-remainder'.  As always with while-loop
patterns, take a moment to ensure that there's no way it will
repeat forever.  If it's meant to decrement a counter by
`cl-decf' or consume a list one item at a time by `pop', consider
doing that before anything else in the function body.

If a loop does end up repeating forever, you can stop it with
\\[asyncloop-reset-all].

Optional argument DEBUG controls whether or not to create a
buffer of debug messages \(named according to ID\).

Optional argument LAUNCH-MESSAGE is a string with which to enrich
debug messages: it'll be printed when the loop starts."

To have a function in FUNS repeat itself until some condition is
met (in the style of a while-loop), have it push itself onto the
result of `asyncloop-remainder', effectively shoving itself back
onto the front of the queue of things-to-execute:

  (unless some-condition
    (push #'this-function (asyncloop-remainder loop)))

As always with while-loop patterns, take a moment to ensure that
there's no way it will repeat forever.  If it's meant to
decrement a counter by `cl-decf' or consume a list one item at a
time by `pop', consider doing that before anything else in the
function body that could hit a bug.

Optional string DEBUG-BUFFER-NAME controls whether to create a
buffer of debug messages, and if so, its name.

It does not matter what the functions in FUNS return, but the
debug buffer prints the return values, so by returning something
interesting (I suggest a short string constructed by `format'),
you can improve your debugging experience."
