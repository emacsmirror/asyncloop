Considered various other names for the package:

- function-queue
- queue
- chain
- timer-chain
- ... others, forgotten

I find the name "function-queue" very descriptive, but the problem is that it doesn't sound like a namespace!  The package ships a function named `function-queue-apply-transaction' which sounds like it does some sort of transaction of function queues?  And that's misleading.

Emacs core can use namespaces like that, MELPA packages shouldn't.  Thus, I dub thee "asyncloop".
