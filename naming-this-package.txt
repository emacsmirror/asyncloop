Considered names for the package:

- function-queue
- queue
- chain
- timer-chain
- nbt (for "non-blocking thread")
- ...

I find "function-queue" very descriptive, but the problem is that it doesn't
sound like a namespace!  The package may ship a function named
`function-queue-apply-transaction' which sounds like it does some sort of
transaction of function queues?  That's misleading.

Emacs core can use namespaces like that, MELPA packages shouldn't.  Thus I dub
thee "asyncloop".
